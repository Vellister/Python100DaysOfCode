# PDF to Audiobook Converter

This project provides a Python script to convert PDF files into audiobooks, using **PyPDF2** for text extraction and **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech) for speech synthesis.

## Features
- Extract text from PDF files.
- Convert extracted text to audio (MP3 format).
- Support for multiple languages in speech synthesis.
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Requirements
- Python 3 installed.
- Required libraries:
  - `PyPDF2`
  - `gTTS`

## Installation
Clone this repository or download the project files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-to-audiobook.git

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install PyPDF2 gTTS

**How to Use**
Run the pdf_to_audiobook.py script directly from the command line.

Basic Usage
bash
python3 pdf_to_audiobook.py your_file.pdf
By default, the language is Portuguese (pt) and the output file is named audiobook.mp3.

Example
python3 pdf_to_audiobook.py example.pdf
Command-Line Options
-o, --output: Set the output audio file name (default: audiobook.mp3).

-l, --lang: Set the language code for speech synthesis (default: pt).
See the gTTS documentation for supported language codes (e.g., en for English, es for Spanish).

Example with options:

bash
python3 pdf_to_audiobook.py my_book.pdf -o my_book_audio.mp3 -l en
This will convert my_book.pdf to my_book_audio.mp3 using an English voice.

Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling for:

PDF file not found.

Issues during text extraction.

Errors during text-to-speech conversion (e.g., API connection problems or rate limits).
